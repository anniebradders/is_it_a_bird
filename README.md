Is it a bird??

little guessing game for flights which are flying overhead using flightradarAPI 

To run:
Run python -m venv venv
Run venv\Scripts\activate (Windows) or source venv/bin/activate (Mac)
Run pip install requests geocoder FlightRadarAPI airportsdata beautifulsoup4 in terminal

Future action planned:
- split into classes
- add requirements.txt file (easier to run than pip install ...)
- add GUI
